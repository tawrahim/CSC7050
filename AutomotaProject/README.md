### Automota Project
This program creates an automota based on some user input
and then generates a state machine

It also asks the user for a string and then we match it against our state machine to see if it is valid

#### Usage
```
	javac Main.java
	java Main
```

####NB
We are not doing any rigrous error checking and we assume that user would not try and say a next state that does not exists.
